# The many favours of guacamole => git version control manual & quick look at markdown
An example repository for introductory **git** training. 

- Try to split changes, for example correct typo and format in different commit changes so that when undoing typo, one does not undo formatting
  - sub bullets are added like this _italics_ and ~~arrowthroughtheheart  ~~>
  - cursor auto-jumps as well hmmm, useful in python 
- and links added like this [the awesome bio-it](http://bio-it.embl.de)

`code can be highlighted with backticks "`" `

```Python 
# ```Python this tells the markdown to format this as python code wow =O
for filename in filenames:
  print(filename)
  # this is kinda cool
```
