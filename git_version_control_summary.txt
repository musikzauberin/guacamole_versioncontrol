##### GIT VERSION CONTROL WORKSHOP BY EMBL BIO_IT TOBY HODGES #####

Git != GitHub

Git: command-line software for managing file versions and project development

GitHub: Web service hosting projects and providing extra features 
e.g. to facilitate collaboration

### GitHub
# History -> history
# Blame -> shows every line edits and by whom
# Raw -> what the files look like in plain text

# if go to history -> click random numbers -> if you browse file/repository at that point in time -> different tree -> go back click the project name


### TERMINAL
# move to folder on com in terminal -> git clone http://XXX

git config --global user.name "Jia Le Lim" # tell git who we are
git config --global user.email "email address" 
# email address used to register git
git config --global core.editor 'nano -w'
# default is vin text editor, this text editer is more user friendly

# add text
nano filename.txt
# command + o (save) , command + x (exit)
git add README.md 
git commit -m "message for commit"
git push
git status

# create new text file
nano notes.txt

# every commit has its own serial number
# cloning depository allows for history to be saved/still seen

# looking at history on terminal
git log 
# exit by typing q

# change file names
mv guacamole_recipe.txt guacamole_recipe.md
# note save this as .md to show as markdown file and not textfile

git commit
# opens text editor to allow multiple lines of git commit message

# use git to show differences between commits
git diff eb4ec72761792f83e0eabd798e9d97a8984a189d master
# get numbers from git log
git checkout eb4ec72761792f83e0eabd798e9d97a8984a189d guacamole_recipe.md 
# look at the file at that state
# if you do
git checkout eb4ec72761792f83e0eabd798e9d97a8984a189d 
# without filename -> detached HEAD state haha
git checkout master 
# fixes the problem and your HEAD is now attached muhahaha

git diff HEAD~1 README.md 
# show differences between commit-1 and current state of file
git diff HEAD~5 README.md 
# show differences between five previous commit and current state of file
git diff HEAD~5
# show differences between five previous commit and master

# To tell git to ignore files
nano .gitignore
# in the .gitignore file
*.tmp
